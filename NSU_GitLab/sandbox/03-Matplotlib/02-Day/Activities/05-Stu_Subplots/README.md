# Formula 1 Subplots

For this assignment, you will use `plt.sublot()` to compare Formula 1 lap times recorded from two drivers: Ayrton Senna and Michael Schumacher.

## Instructions:

1. Use `plt.subplot()` to create a figure with a 1x2 subplot layout. Make this first subplot active.

2. Plot the lap times recorded by Ayrton Senna. 

3. Use `plt.subplot()` to make the second subplot active in the 1x2 subplot grid.

4. Plot the lap times recorded by Michael Schumacher. 

5. Add appropriated x and y labels.

6. **Bonus**: Matplotlib comes with a number of different stylesheets to customize the overall look of different plots. Research a  stylesheet of your choosing and activate it.
