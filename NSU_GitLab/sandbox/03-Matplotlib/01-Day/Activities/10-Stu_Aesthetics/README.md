# Hemi Engine Performance - Adding Aesthetics to the Plot 

In this activity, you will create a line chart that graphs the performance of the 6.2-liter Hellcat V8 automobile engine. Then you will style and  add aesthetics to the chart.

#### Instructions:

1. Create a line chart with two plots using the following data:

    * For Power(bhp) and Torque(lbft), start at 0 and finish at 800 with increments of 100.
      
    * For the RPM, start at 500 and finish at 6500 with increments of 100.

2. When plotting the data, style using following parameters:
  
    * Shape of data points: Markers. (See Matplotlib Markers link in the Hints section for more information.)
      
    * Set colors for each plot. 
      
    * Add appropriate labels to the x- and y-axes and add a title to the chart.
      
    * Set limits for the x- and y-axes.
    
    * Add a grid to the chart.
      
3. Lastly, save the chart to the Images folder.

4. **Bonus:** If time permits, navigate to [Matplotlib example visualizations](https://matplotlib.org/3.3.3/gallery/index.html) and look for a plot similar to the one you created in this activity. Then try to implement new features you find in the example code.

#### Hints:

* See Matplotlib documentation for [matplotlib.markers](https://matplotlib.org/api/markers_api.html).
