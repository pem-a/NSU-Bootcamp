# CitiBike - Grouped Charts

For this assignment, you will use a Jersey City CitiBike dataset from 2010 and create charts to determine which type of customer borrows and uses bikes most often.

### Instructions:

1. Open the [starter file](Unsolved/citibike_groupby_unsolved.ipynb).

2. Import your dependencies and then import your data into a Pandas DataFrame.

3. Split up your data into groups based on customer type.

4. Chart your data using a bar graph, giving it a title and labeling its axes.

5. **Bonus:** If time permits, navigate to [Matplotlib example visualizations](https://matplotlib.org/3.3.3/gallery/index.html) and look for a plot similar to the one you created in this activity. Then try to implement new features you find in the example code.
