## New York Weather

In this activity, you will plot the monthly averages for temperature in New York in both degrees Fahrenheit and degrees Celsius.

### Instructions:

1. On the x-axis, assign a range of numerical values representing each month of the year.
  
2. Using the following data, plot the degrees Fahrenheit points.

      -  Average temperature per month in Fahrenheit: 39, 42, 51, 62, 72, 82, 86, 84, 77, 65, 55, 44. 

3. Use a list comprehension to convert the temperature to degrees Celsius.
      
    -  The formula for conversion is: C = (F – 32) * 0.56. Where C is degrees Celsius and F is degrees Fahrenheit.
  
4. Plot the degrees Celsius points.
  
5. Create a third plot with both the degrees Fahrenheit and degrees Celsius points.

6. **Bonus**: Modify the third plot by adding the following:

    * Change the Fahrenheit line to blue and the Celsius line to red.

    * Add square markers to Fahrenheit and plus markers to Celsius. (See documentation for Matplotlib markers.)

    * Set legends to where the chart thinks is best. 

    * Create labels for the x (Months) and y (Degrees) axis.

#### Hints:
        
  * See the [Matplotlib documentation](https://matplotlib.org/3.3.3/tutorials/introductory/pyplot.html#sphx-glr-tutorials-introductory-pyplot-py) for more information regarding the Pyplot library.

  * See the [Matplotlib markers](https://matplotlib.org/3.3.3/api/markers_api.html?highlight=markers#module-matplotlib.markers) for more information regarding markers.
        
  * Also look into the [NumPy documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference) for more information on the NumPy library.
