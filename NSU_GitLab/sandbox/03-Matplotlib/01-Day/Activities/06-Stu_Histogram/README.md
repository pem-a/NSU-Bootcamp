# Histogram Group Height

In this activity, you will plot a histogram to show a simulated dataset containing the height distribution in a group of 100 people.

## Instructions:

1. Import dependencies.

2. Create an array using NumPy's `np.random.normal()` function, passing the following as arguments:

    * The mean height of the group should be 175 cm.

    * The standard deviation should be 4 cm. 

    * The total number of people should be 100.

3. Build the histogram using `plt.hist()`.

4. **Bonus**: Create labels for the axes and add a grid to your final plot.
